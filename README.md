# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## steps to do this project

1. create react app install reducx and react-redux
2. write html/jsx code + css in app.js to display ui.
3. write actions which we are going to use in this app in action file.
4. tell reducers to do this actions(write all the code in particular reducer).
5. import all the written reducers in one single main reducer using combineReducer from redux.
6. now create store.
7. in created store import your main / rootReeducer in it.
8. import store in index.js .
9. wrap your entire app in index.js with provider tag using from react-redux.
10. pass your store in this provider tag in index.js so that store will be connected to main app.js .
11. now create myState in app.js and use useSelector tag from react-redux to pass myState in it also pass this   myState in value.
12. now use dispatch to call actions in app.js .
13. then write onClick function where you want to it to be execute.
14. import your actions in app.js which you are going to use in onclick function so that with the help of dispatch it will call.
15. pass the parameter which you want to be execute first in app.js on onClick function then pass this parameter in action which it is going to be use using payload also update that particular reducer by adding payload.
